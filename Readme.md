# AI-Based Job Recommendation System

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered job recommendation system that matches users with relevant job listings based on their skills. The system uses NLP techniques to preprocess job descriptions and user profiles, and a machine learning model to provide job recommendations.

## Features
- User profile and job listing preprocessing
- AI-based job recommendation using NLP and ML techniques
- Web interface for users to input skills and get job recommendations
- Data storage and management with CSV files

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js (or preferred framework)
- **Backend:** Flask / FastAPI (Python-based API for recommendations)
- **AI Model:** Scikit-learn, Transformers (BERT), NLTK, Pandas
- **Database:** CSV / SQLite (for storing jobs and user profiles)

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.9+ installed. Install the required dependencies using:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```

## Usage
### 1. Preprocess the Data
Before training the model, clean and preprocess the job listings and user data:

```sh
python scripts/preprocess.py
```

### 2. Train the Model
Train the recommendation model on the cleaned data:

```sh
python scripts/train_model.py
```

### 3. Run the Recommendation System
Once trained, use the model to generate job recommendations:

```sh
python scripts/recommend.py
```

### 4. Run the API Server
Start the backend server to allow the frontend to access recommendations:

```sh
python api/app.py
```

### 5. Start the Frontend
Navigate to the frontend folder and start the React app:

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## How It Works
1. **Preprocessing:** Cleans job descriptions and user profiles by removing stopwords, punctuation, and standardizing text.
2. **Feature Extraction:** Uses NLP techniques (TF-IDF, BERT embeddings) to convert text data into numerical format.
3. **Model Training:** Trains a machine learning model (Logistic Regression / Neural Network) to match users with job listings.
4. **Recommendation:** When a user inputs their skills, the system compares them with job descriptions and ranks relevant jobs.
